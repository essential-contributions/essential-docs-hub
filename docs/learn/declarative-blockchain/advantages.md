## Advantages for Users

Declarative blockchains put users first by enabling a streamlined, outcome-oriented experience.

### Optimal Outcomes
- **Competitive Solver Network**: Users benefit from a competitive network of solvers, each striving to maximize user satisfaction through optimal outcomes.
- **Access to Entire On-Chain Solution Space**: Users' intended outcomes are dynamically matched with the optimal solution path at the moment of inclusion, rather than being locked into a rigid sequence.
- **Protection from MEV**: Value extraction opportunities, like Miner Extractable Value (MEV), are minimized, ensuring that the benefits of transaction efficiency flow back to the user.
- **Fair Sequencing**: Transaction ordering and inclusion are based on user-defined outcomes, ensuring that sequencing is fair and aligns with users' best interests.

### Enhanced User Experience
- **No Failed Transactions**: Declarative blockchains eliminate the possibility of failed transactions, leading to a smoother experience.
- **Native Account Abstraction**: Users can interact with the blockchain more flexibly, with accounts natively abstracted for simpler, more intuitive use.
- **Flexible UI Interaction**: Users can interact with the blockchain through any UI, without being tied to specific interfaces or platforms.

## Advantages for Developers

Declarative blockchains empower developers to build more sophisticated applications without the constraints of traditional execution models.

### Unbounded Complexity
- **Scalable Complexity**: With no on-chain execution, applications can be as complex as needed without driving up gas costs. This opens the door to richer, more sophisticated applications.

### Simplified, Secure Development
- **Focus on Logic, Not Algorithms**: Developers only need to define application logic, without worrying about managing detailed algorithms or execution steps.
- **Reduced Complexity and Risk**: By eliminating the need for intricate VM-specific knowledge, developers can avoid many common security pitfalls, leading to safer, more reliable code.

## Advantages for Web3

Declarative blockchains represent a leap forward for the scalability and decentralization of the web3 ecosystem.

### Next-Gen Scalability
- **Efficient Validation**: With no on-chain execution, validating the blockchain becomes faster and more cost-effective, enabling larger block sizes and higher throughput.
- **Affordable Scaling**: The absence of in-protocol execution significantly reduces computational costs, making large-scale applications more feasible.

### Built for Decentralization
- **Decentralized by Design**: Declarative blockchains deliver massive throughput without sacrificing decentralization, ensuring that the benefits of scalability are not achieved at the expense of network integrity.
- **Future-Proof Infrastructure**: The declarative model supports a decentralized future by making it easier to add, validate, and maintain blocks in a scalable manner.

Declarative blockchains offer a powerful alternative to traditional imperative models. By prioritizing user outcomes, developer ease, and decentralized scalability, they represent a new frontier in blockchain technology, bringing us closer to a seamless, user-centric web3 experience.
