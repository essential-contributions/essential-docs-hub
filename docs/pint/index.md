# Pint

**Pint** is a **declarative programming language** designed for building blockchain applications. Unlike imperative languages (e.g., Solidity), where you must specify each step of execution, **declarative programming** in Pint focuses on describing the logic and goals of the program rather than its explicit steps. In other words, with Pint, you describe **what the program should accomplish** rather than **how to accomplish it**.

## Constraint-Based Language

Pint is a **constraint-based language**:
- A Pint program is essentially a collection of **predicates**, and each predicate is a collection of **constraints**.
- Since blockchain applications focus on **state transitions**, constraints allow you to specify which state changes are valid, without needing to define how the state changes should occur.

This approach lets developers **define permissible state changes** rather than detailing each action needed to reach a new state.

#### How to Use This Section

This section is structured to be read **in sequence from front to back**:
- Later sections build on concepts introduced in earlier ones.
- Earlier sections may touch on topics without exploring them fully, with deeper discussions in later ones.

While this can be used as a **reference**, keep in mind that it is **not fully comprehensive.**
