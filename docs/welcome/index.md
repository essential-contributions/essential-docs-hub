# Welcome to Essential

<h4 class="welcome-subtitle">Essential is the first declarative blockchain, advancing the shift from value extraction to intent satisfaction.</h4>

Welcome to Essential, the first **declarative blockchain**. We’re transforming Web3 from a model focused on value extraction to one driven by **intent satisfaction**. Here, you don’t just send transactions—you define high-level goals, or **intents**, and let the network figure out the best way to achieve them.

For users, this means **seamless, predictable outcomes**. Developers experience **less complexity** and **faster innovation**. And for the Web3 ecosystem, it brings **scalability, lower costs, and robust decentralization**.

Ready to explore or start building? This docs hub has everything you need to dive in. Your feedback is always welcome as we continue to expand and improve Essential.
