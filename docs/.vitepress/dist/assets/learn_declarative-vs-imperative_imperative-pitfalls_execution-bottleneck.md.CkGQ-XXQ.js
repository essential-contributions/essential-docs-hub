These layers were expected to optimize for fast, scalable execution without compromising decentralization. By enabling proofs on the underlying Layer 1 (L1), they could outsource security to the parent chain while operating with lower security guarantees on the execution layer itself.</p><p>Many anticipated that Layer 2 (L2) fees would become negligible as consensus and data availability (DA) layers evolved to offer cheap blobspace. The expectation was that execution would become the bottleneck, driving innovation toward faster, parallel execution models to scale throughput.</p><p>However, this narrative hasn’t played out as expected. In reality, demand for outcomes far exceeds demand for execution.

However, on imperative execution layers, sequencers hold monopolistic control over supply and demand allocation. With the power to decide transaction inclusion and ordering, they can extract value that would otherwise benefit sellers.</p><p>Instead of charging fees that align with their actual costs (i.e., the cost of blobspace and computation), sequencers can impose arbitrarily high fees due to their intermediary position.
